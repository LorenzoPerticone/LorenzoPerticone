Currently a PhD Student at Chalmers University of Technology.

My background is mostly in mathematics. My academic interests include (higher) category theory, algebraic geometry and topology, (classical and constructive) logic and theoretical computer science. I am especially fascinated by the rich interplay between these subjects.
